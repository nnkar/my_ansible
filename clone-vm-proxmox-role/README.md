Role clone-vm-proxmox-role
=========


Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - name: clone-vm-proxmox-role
      hosts: "{{ w_host | default('test') }}"
      roles:
         - { role: clone-vm-proxmox-role }
